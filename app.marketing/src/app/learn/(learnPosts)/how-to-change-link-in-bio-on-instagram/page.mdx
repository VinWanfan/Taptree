};

Updating the link in your Instagram bio is quick and straightforward:

1. Open the Instagram app and go to your profile by tapping on your profile picture in the bottom right corner.

2. Tap the "Edit Profile" button located just beneath your follower count.

3. Locate the "Website" field and enter your new desired link or update the existing one.

4. Once you've entered the correct URL, tap "Done" (or the checkmark) in the upper right corner to save your changes.

Your bio will now display the updated link to your followers.

export default function MDXArticle(props) {
return <ArticleTemplate meta={metadata}>{props.children}</ArticleTemplate>;

}
