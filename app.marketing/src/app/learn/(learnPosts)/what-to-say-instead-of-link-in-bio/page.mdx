import { ArticleTemplate } from '../../learn-template';

export const metadata = {
  title: 'What to say instead of link in bio?',
  publishDate: '2025-03-22',
  category: 'link-in-bio',
};

Instead of using the common phrase "link in bio," you can use alternative expressions to encourage followers to visit your profile. Popular options include "Visit my profile to learn more," "Tap the link on my Instagram profile for details," "Check out the link on my page," or "Head to my profile URL for more information."

Using different wording can help your posts feel fresh, engaging, and less repetitive.

export default function MDXArticle(props) {
return <ArticleTemplate meta={metadata}>{props.children}</ArticleTemplate>;

}
